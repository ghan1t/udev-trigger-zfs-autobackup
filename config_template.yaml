# List any pools you want to backup
# - pool_name: the name of the pool, also the label under /dev/disk/by-label/
#              current limitation is that each pool_name can only be used once
# - split_parameters: optional parameter (true by default), splits zfs-autobackup parameters on spaces into separate cli parameters.
#                     E.g. if you use '--set-properties readonly=on' this needs to be true, otherwise you need to split it into two
#                     parameters yourself.
# - autobackup_parameters: the command line arguments you want to pass to zfs-autobackup
# - passphrase: optional encryption passphrase, can be an empty string
